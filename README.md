# MIPT Little Assistant
This Android app was made for competitions at the Department of General and Applied Physics of MIPT student initiation. The main features are NFC tag reading and displaying specified contest info upon reading a corresponding tag, QR-code scanning (QR code was used to finish the contest), map of contests and a "contest chat assistant" called Jarvis which provides participants with information about their next information when they read the right QR code and some information about their current task when you read an NFC tag.
